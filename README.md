## Project Description

### Introduction

#### High-level Approach
Our solution to mitigate campus bicycle theft is a three-prong approach involving two hardware solutions and one software solution combined together into one system. Our goal for our system is to improve awareness and response time to ongoing bicycle theft and give students an ease of mind and a feeling of security when parking their bicycles on campus.

#### First Hardware Solution - Bicycle Device PCB
Our first hardware solution is a PCB that can be attached to a bicycle that will alert the owner on their web/mobile devices if there are any recognized sounds of a bicycle lock being cut, and also will alert the owner if there is detection of motion of the bicycle when the owner has specified they are in class. 

#### Second Hardware Solution - Security Camera PCB
Our second hardware solution is a PCB that will overlook a bicycle parking location and be able to stream video feed to the user if they want to check on their bicycle,  it should also be able to recognize when a specific bicycle is being moved when it shouldn’t be and alert the user. Eventually it should also be able to record and gather evidence when a bicycle is stolen. 

#### Software Solution - Web & Mobile Application
Our third approach is a web application that will tie the two hardware solutions together by handling the logic of how to alert the mobile / web applications given a signal from either of the two PCBs. This will be both a web and mobile application where users can view video feeds of a parking spot, handle alerts from application and alert the corresponding user, and be a place where users manually alert others of suspicious activity.
